00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:22,163
<i>The Institution</i>

2
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:40,679
To the barricades!

3
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:25,863
Herr von Wagner!

4
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:28,234
Herr Uthoff!

5
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,845
How do you get past our barricades?

6
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,040
I took the lift

7
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,250
That's what happens when your barricade has to have disabled access

8
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,409
Herr Timoschenko.
- I... I ...
- What exactly are you doing here?

9
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:52,409
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,659
What exactly are you doing here, paralympics or something?

11
00:01:59,659 --> 00:01:59,660
7 days 7 pigtails, or what?
What exactly are you doing here, paralympics or something?

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,519
7 days 7 pigtails, or what?

13
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,890
What does it look like?  We're having a revolution!

14
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:09,786
Stop that, you're just associating yourself with the common people

15
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,928
Which has become a recurring theme in uprisings

16
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,719
Every time

17
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,258
You think you...

18
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:18,260
Tell me... why is there Cyrillic on that banner?

19
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:18,378
Solidarity with the Ukraine!
Tell me... why is there Cyrillic on that banner?

20
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:20,475
Solidarity with the Ukraine!

21
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,398
It's now time to instill the fire of revolution into the hearts of our citizens, too,

22
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:29,489
and to sweep away these corrupt elitists!

23
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,868
And you're doing that by performing a musical of Les Miserables?

24
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:36,419
You see, merely setting the rigid conditions

25
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,118
to your own melody is enough to make them dance

26
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:43,229
Lovely, Andrew Lloyd Webber?

27
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,059
Karl Marx

28
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:48,399
- And who are these people?
- All battle-ready citizens, let me introduce

29
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:51,199
- Comrade Pussy
- I'm with you!

30
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,419
Comrade Bussy

31
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:59,419
Busse!

32
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,349
Who's the guy over there on the right?

33
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,949
We prefer not to know the exact details

34
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,639
but he found us the weapons

35
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,128
Let's go

36
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,426
Tell me, have you forgotten who we are?

37
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:20,912
- No, we are the Occupiers of the Institution
- That's right!

38
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:25,489
The Action of Fanatical Democrats, for short, the AF...

39
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,669
We should stick to the longer version

40
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:31,539
We are here to objectively explain political factors

41
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:36,588
Let me guess, he's in charge of the positive atmosphere?

42
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:40,478
Herr Uthoff, you won't manage to choke our revolutionary fire this time!

43
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,650
Isn't that right, men?

44
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,959
Tell me, do you really believe

45
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,718
that people these days trust amateurs like you with something as important as revolution?

46
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:51,539
We're not amateurs, we're doing this as in a voluntary capacity,

47
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,719
okay, but we're not...
- Voluntary?

48
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,079
Unpaid?

49
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,159
That's not what you said earlier

50
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,838
What did he say?

51
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:02,568
We're walking out

52
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:09,109
It's a miracle!  I'm walking!

53
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:24,097
Herr von Wagner, today revolutions in the Ukraine are organised by professionals

54
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:25,669
Here, by him, for example

55
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:25,852
Yeah, Witali Klitschko, now that's a real revolutionary!
Here, by him, for example

56
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:26,860
Yeah, Witali Klitschko, now that's a real revolutionary!

57
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,734
Have you ever heard him speaking without notes?
Yeah, Witali Klitschko, now that's a real revolutionary!

58
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:31,059
Have you ever heard him speaking without notes?

59
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:34,769
Don't be unfair, he's spent his entire life wearing a mouthgard

60
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:34,770
I don't think he can even speak Ukrainian properly, but he wants to be president there
Don't be unfair, he's spent his entire life wearing a mouthgard

61
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,299
I don't think he can even speak Ukrainian properly, but he wants to be president there

62
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,449
You know, I'd be happier if I didn't understand every word

63
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,158
our president says

64
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:47,788
Forget it

65
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,228
Forget this puppet from the Konrad Adenauer Foundation

66
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:54,558
No, the real pro is on his right, John McCain,

67
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:58,063
former US presidential candidate, here in December on the Maidan

68
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:58,103
McCain, what's he doing there, selling fries?
former US presidential candidate, here in December on the Maidan

69
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,677
McCain, what's he doing there, selling fries?

70
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:05,968
The man's been working with his foundation for a long time

71
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:09,299
at giving the Ukranians a taste for a market-compliant democracy

72
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:09,430
- Yeah yeah, and then they have to suck...
- Huh?
at giving the Ukranians a taste for a market-compliant democracy

73
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,118
- Yeah yeah, and then they have to suck...
- Huh?

74
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:13,918
Yep, succumb to the West

75
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:15,269
The Americans have invested

76
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:20,269
a total of $5 billion into the coup in the Ukraine
- Yeah, says Putin

77
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:23,338
- No, Victoria Nuland
- Fuck you

78
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,795
Look, there she was on the Maidan in December,

79
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:30,068
the acting US Foreign Secretary

80
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:33,519
Look at that, the Americans as the breadgivers

81
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:33,520
of Ukrainian Revolution
Look at that, the Americans as the breadgivers

82
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,509
of Ukrainian Revolution

83
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,254
Imagine that the other way round

84
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:41,528
Putin goes to the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators, gives out solyanka,

85
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:46,279
millions of dollars, then sits down and says, "Mr. President,

86
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,527
tear down this Wall Street."

87
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:51,480
OK, now we've

88
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,360
OK, now we've established neatly that the Americans are the bad guys,

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,123
but the Russians can attack a sovereign country just like that?

90
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,930
Now you'll say "They were just having a carnival party,

91
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,168
Shrove Monday in Crimea."

92
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:14,060
You know, with military uniforms from a party store

93
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,889
<i>Puten touches the Ukraine from behind, on the shoulder...</i>

94
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,459
You know what I'll tell you?

95
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:19,460
What the Russians did was against the law of nations
You know what I'll tell you?

96
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,299
What the Russians did was against the law of nations

97
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,478
The American Foreign Secretary said it beautifully,

98
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:28,482
he said, "No country should invade another under false pretenses,

99
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,809
to further its own interests."

100
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,901
Hey, would you mind repeating that sentence?

101
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,669
Yes of course.  "No country should invade another

102
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:40,909
under false pretenses, to..."

103
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,509
<i>Those are Sadam's weapons</i>

104
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:59,799
The language of diplomacy, hm?  Easily tainted in the time of propaganda

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,879
When the needle points to "War", it's best to listen the enemy's broadcasts

106
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,338
So, everything the Russian intelligence happens to reveal

107
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:10,098
Rolling off the imperial tongue,

108
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:13,899
Western leaders prattle on about

109
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,869
how they see the future in the Ukraine.

110
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,886
Or who really did shoot on the Maidan.

111
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,259
The German media don't normally pick up on that

112
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,430
because they're too busy with their shortwave radios,

113
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,240
looking for stories which confirm

114
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,689
their views of the evil Putin

115
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:31,649
And so,

116
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:31,650
Hitler comparisons go wild
And so,

117
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,784
Hitler comparisons go wild

118
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,384
like crocusses in a pile of dogpoo

119
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,205
It's true of all Nazi comparisons that not everything lame

120
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:42,158
is Joseph Goebbels

121
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:47,829
However it goes without saying that Frank Steinmeier,

122
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,219
our new Foreign Affairs Authority,

123
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,879
is the best Foreign Affairs Minister since...

124
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,528
our last one

125
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:58,459
Steinmeier, a four,

126
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:02,038
four-star diplomat, at the Munich Security Conference,

127
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:03,408
commanded the democratically elected

128
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:06,949
Ukrainian President to kindly accept

129
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,499
all demands of the Maidan demonstrators

130
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:14,769
Well, that's a tradition in our country

131
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:18,959
Every protest movement we can start is accepted here

132
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,278
That heats up the conflict and is good for our arms export

133
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:26,838
Embarrassing really, for years, German foreign affairs have suffered

134
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:29,016
from premature escalation

135
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:34,089
But, what an effect our Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-and-Stein has

136
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,490
Hmm?

137
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,870
They endure months

138
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,729
in the bitter cold, at some point shots are fired, blood flows, but only

139
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,809
when the danger menaces that Steinmeier could hold a speech,

140
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:43,810
does everyone sit down at the negotiation table and sign
when the danger menaces that Steinmeier could hold a speech,

141
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,709
does everyone sit down at the negotiation table and sign

142
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,070
Frank Maier sign... Frank-Walter Steinmeier signed

143
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,500
the contract too

144
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,350
Well, the man signs

145
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,360
everything

146
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,080
I don't even want to know how many magazine subscriptions he has

147
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,490
So he...

148
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,360
So he enthusiastically shakes the hands of the Nazis from the Swoboda party

149
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,899
and wonders why one hour later, these shady characters

150
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,139
break the contract

151
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:15,500
I think this is a matter for the Guiness Book of Records:
Five weeks

152
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
after the reorientation of German Foreign Affairs,

153
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,919
Nazis enter the Ukranian government

154
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,240
Never before could we observe so neatly

155
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,549
how it looks when the West

156
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:30,539
exploits a new country as a globalised

157
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,379
shopping mall

158
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:39,379
The International Monetary Fund

159
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,299
The IMF

160
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:43,729
offered Janukowytsch

161
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,440
several billion but only under the condition that he

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,155
raise the gas prices by 40%, inline with the market

163
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:55,297
And even a greedy moron like him couldn't accept that

164
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:56,344
And soon,

165
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,179
the international PR was running at full speed

166
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:02,639
Let's not get confused, this is not a conspiracy theory

167
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,850
this is conspiracy reality

168
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,860
The demonstrators freeze their arses of on the Maidan, and what

169
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,120
will they get out of it?

170
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,240
Higher gas prices

171
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,490
My dear Ukranians, those are the additional expenses of freedom

172
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,139
Actually, I wanted to defend Putin here

173
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,460
That the man is also allowed to have interests

174
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,029
That you can flip out when NATO, despite their promises,

175
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:27,030
are always cozying up from behind
That you can flip out when NATO, despite their promises,

176
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,319
are always cozying up from behind

177
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,029
But then I saw that his pal, the flawless Gerhard Schröder,

178
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:35,030
also defended him
But then I saw that his pal, the flawless Gerhard Schröder,

179
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,039
also defended him

180
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,019
with the splendid point that he would have also loved to break the law of nations

181
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,659
by bombing Serbia

182
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:45,569
and so we shouldn't point the finger now

183
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,600
Of course Schröder always showed the law of nations

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,250
his middle finger

185
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,750
And now

186
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,240
And now I am forced to change my opinion, because if history

187
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,579
has taught us one thing,

188
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:01,308
it's that when Gerhard Schröder thinks something is right, it can't be

189
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:02,829
more wrong

190
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,301
And that's why...

191
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,830
Excuse me, I am right in the middle of my solo
And that's why...

192
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,733
Excuse me, I am right in the middle of my solo

193
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,181
Oh, forgive me, Herr Uthoff, of course we all find it excellent

194
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:18,399
that you're sculpting the satirical stucco

195
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,400
onto the bourgeois ceiling of the circumstances
that you're sculpting the satirical stucco

196
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,811
onto the bourgeois ceiling of the circumstances

197
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:24,099
You don't sculpt stucco

198
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,919
You see, that's exactly what I mean.  No more of these lofty word landscapes

199
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:27,920
We want to finally see some heads roll!  Huh?
- Yes!
You see, that's exactly what I mean.  No more of these lofty word landscapes

200
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,202
We want to finally see some heads roll!  Huh?
- Yes!

201
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:31,952
Why not?  We have a guillotine here.

202
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,169
Oh oh, I faint at the sight of blood

203
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,465
Oh, don't worry about that

204
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,936
We have one for the Society of Humane Decaptiation

205
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:41,819
So

206
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,390
Now I'd like to make a few suggestions.
Well, who shall it be?

207
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,341
Janukowytsch, Janukowytsch!

208
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:50,688
Yes, what is he accused of?

209
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:51,091
- Um, he opressed his people...
- Yes!
Yes, what is he accused of?

210
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:53,027
- Um, he opressed his people...
- Yes!

211
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:54,777
Yes but he was elected by this people

212
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,788
Ah, the OECD said that too, but...

213
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:58,359
Come on, when you just eliminate any democratically

214
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:58,388
elected representative whose voters don't like him,
Come on, when you just eliminate any democratically

215
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:01,369
elected representative whose voters don't like him,

216
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,190
Hessen would have to vote yet again

217
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,481
Wulf, Wulf, Wulf, Wulf! [politician, allegedly bribed]

218
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,889
- What are the charges?
- He's a corrupt oligarch with a wonderful villa

219
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,589
But he was just acquitted

220
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:23,269
- But he did leave us with Gauk
- Gauk!  Gauk!

221
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,689
But why?

222
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,149
Um, well, Gauk declared himself guilty in Greece

223
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:28,150
- Morally but not legally
- And why is that?
Um, well, Gauk declared himself guilty in Greece

224
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,962
- Morally but not legally
- And why is that?

225
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,259
That was cheaper

226
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:32,712
Listen,
That was cheaper

227
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:33,610
Listen,

228
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,460
could you please

229
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,259
just decide?

230
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,192
- Blüm!  Blüm!  Norbert Blüm!
- What?

231
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,190
Please forgive me, but that was a cabarett reflex

232
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,057
from the 80s

233
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,285
- Then let's behead Friedrich!
- Yes!

234
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,665
But what should the charges be?

235
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:05,120
He never used his head

236
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,169
Crap.  Then Merkel maybe?
He never used his head

237
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,110
Crap.  Then Merkel maybe?

238
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,558
Merkel, Merkel, Merkel!

239
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:12,120
That is your first good idea, but

240
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,629
but, but, but why?

241
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:18,649
- Hey, what has she done these days?
- I'd also like to know!  What's actually

242
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,789
her full-time job?

243
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:22,889
Maybe Gabriel?

244
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,178
Gabriel!  Gabriel!  [head of the SPD]

245
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:28,350
Oh, come on, he wouldn't even fit in the guillotine

246
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,087
Then we'll use the electric chair

247
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:32,921
Yes, with wind power!

248
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,899
Wait, the major electrical grid's not even finished yet

249
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:36,900
Because of Seehofer!
- Seehofer!  Seehofer!
Wait, the major electrical grid's not even finished yet

250
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,579
Because of Seehofer!
- Seehofer!  Seehofer!

251
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,509
Wait, you couldn't get Seehofer on the guillotine

252
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:45,850
He turns so quickly, I'd end up just cutting his toenails

253
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,250
Ah!

254
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,860
The shame of the SPD!

255
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,309
Bowereit?

256
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:54,310
He's in the SPD?
Bowereit?

257
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,019
He's in the SPD?

258
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,282
I was thinking more of the Edathy

259
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:02,281
Edati!  Edati!  [found in possession of child pornography]

260
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:05,350
Theoretically I agree with you, but legally I don't think

261
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,882
we could pin anything on him

262
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:09,610
Hedge lawyer!

263
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:09,632
Paragraph screwer!
Hedge lawyer!

264
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,690
Paragraph screwer!

265
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:17,110
<i>Maxi Uthoff is homosexual!  Homosexual, homosexual!</i>

266
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,440
Now I have an idea for you, what about

267
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,842
Uli Hoeneß?  [former football player, evaded €28.5m in taxes]

268
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,142
No, the man has achieved so much!

269
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,660
And anyway, he already executed himself on the first day of the trail

270
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,039
That doesn't matter, then we'll behead him again,

271
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:38,817
the Bavarian...
- Wait, buy why?
That doesn't matter, then we'll behead him again,

272
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:40,909
the Bavarian...
- Wait, buy why?

273
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:42,839
Because it's his fault that the national league

274
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,159
has become so boring
- Yes!  Exactly!

275
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:48,817
We'll buy him!  Uli, Uli!

276
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Wait, people, we can't even afford him!

277
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:13,789
€27m and rising daily!

278
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,059
Yes, lynch justice

279
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,899
So refreshing

280
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:20,900
I feel like 68
So refreshing

281
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,559
I feel like 68

282
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,979
even though I'm now over 70

283
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:32,440
I want to say I think it's fantastic to be 70

284
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,549
and still

285
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:33,550
there at all
and still

286
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,589
there at all

287
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,530
100 years ago that wouldn't have been conceivable, 100 years ago

288
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:44,709
the life expentancy of the average person was 55

289
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,671
And now, on average, we're at 86

290
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:52,850
On average!  There's still breathing room!

291
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,036
Old people have become
On average!  There's still breathing room!

292
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,769
Old people have become

293
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,629
much less perischable

294
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,179
There are old people who are fitter than their chilren!

295
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,559
I can tell you, we have retirement homes in Germany

296
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:03,560
where parent-teacher interviews take place
I can tell you, we have retirement homes in Germany

297
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,079
where parent-teacher interviews take place

298
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:22,230
Moving into a retirement home is of course the second most unmistakable sign

299
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,091
that you're getting old

300
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:25,841
The most unmistakable sign is however

301
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,678
putting a rubber mat with suction caps

302
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:32,069
in the shower

303
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,039
My doctor tells me you can medically establish

304
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,040
someone's biological age like this
My doctor tells me you can medically establish

305
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,779
someone's biological age like this

306
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:43,188
So when you put a rubber mat with suction caps in the shower,

307
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:43,223
you're 70
So when you put a rubber mat with suction caps in the shower,

308
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:46,110
you're 70

309
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,095
When you place it with the suction caps

310
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:50,695
facing upwards,

311
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,220
you're 80

312
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,798
You're 90 when walk through the house with the suction caps sticking to your feet

313
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:08,798
and yell, "Mummy, these new slippers don't fit!"

314
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,769
But that only happens to people in retirement homes

315
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:21,699
They're not active anymore, they think all day about death, please

316
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,907
When you're over 70 like me

317
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:26,963
death's not even standing at the door yet

318
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,279
But he is looking for a parking space

319
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,960
And then it's nice for all the people who live in a pedestrian zone

320
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,975
The best way to avoid death is the way to the doctor

321
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:43,525
Everyone is running there

322
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:48,194
I'm telling you, after 70 people get felt up more often by their doctor

323
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:49,944
than by their own partner

324
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,589
And then they loll about in the waiting room from dawn 'till dusk

325
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:55,590
Always examinations
And then they loll about in the waiting room from dawn 'till dusk

326
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,559
Always examinations

327
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,319
and checkups...  Checkups are a topic in themselves, aren't they?

328
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,579
My circle of friends consists of 8 people, in the last week,

329
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:10,740
7 had a checkup, one for gut, two for prostate,

330
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,720
two for breast cancer and two for uterus

331
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:13,775
And those were all men
two for breast cancer and two for uterus

332
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:15,130
And those were all men

333
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,579
No one knows

334
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:17,580
Not one of them knows
No one knows

335
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,819
Not one of them knows

336
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:22,557
whether all of these checkups actually make a difference

337
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,289
That's why old people are readily persuaded

338
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,143
to have pointless, completely unnecessary operations
That's why old people are readily persuaded

339
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:29,564
to have pointless, completely unnecessary operations

340
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:29,630
That leads however to overworked doctors
to have pointless, completely unnecessary operations

341
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,489
That leads however to overworked doctors

342
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:36,359
and for this reason it often happens that

343
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,959
something

344
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,200
is left behind in recently operated patients

345
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,019
Sometimes some pincers,

346
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:44,410
sometimes a swab,

347
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,944
sometimes a clamp

348
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,099
Now in Rheinland,

349
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:52,100
they operated on Reiner Galmund
Now in Rheinland,

350
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,433
they operated on Reiner Galmund

351
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:58,421
Since then they've lost a small, Korean

352
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,320
operating theatre nurse

353
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:09,490
I'm not going the the doctor anymore!

354
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:14,839
Herr Bosse!

355
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,322
Does this ring a bell?
Herr Bosse!

356
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,361
Does this ring a bell?

357
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:17,589
Not another birthday!
Does this ring a bell?

358
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,887
Not another birthday!

359
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:20,637
No, look at this!

360
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,980
Oh, my pension!  That thing on the right!

361
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:32,544
You must have got a letter as well

362
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:34,294
Yes, we did

363
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,690
Do you know what it was?

364
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,930
Information about my pension scheme.  And what did it say?

365
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,460
My pension is dead

366
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,610
And someone killed it.  You don't by any chance know who that could have been?

367
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,519
Blüm!  Blüm!  Norbert Blüm!

368
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,660
I have to see the doctor sometime about that

369
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,220
Blüm didn't have any motive

370
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,665
But there is one suspect

371
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:01,220
<i>The Old Guy: Pension Murder</i>
But there is one suspect

372
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,497
<i>The Old Guy: Pension Murder</i>

373
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,908
Herr Bosse, why did you kill the young man's pension?

374
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:16,368
That was more like euthanasia

375
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:17,569
Herr Busse

376
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:18,118

Herr Busse

377
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:21,439
Bild am Sonntag, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Fokus, everyone agrees

378
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,589
The old people have killed the pensions, you are part of the old people, do you deny this?

379
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:25,590
If you confess, we'll let you live out your least years in peace
The old people have killed the pensions, you are part of the old people, do you deny this?

380
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,159
If you confess, we'll let you live out your least years in peace

381
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,829
Well they don't belong to me anyway, I'm a public health patient

382
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:35,830
- And you're always getting older
- Yes, although you know that his makes the pensions inaffordable
Well they don't belong to me anyway, I'm a public health patient

383
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,089
- And you're always getting older
- Yes, although you know that his makes the pensions inaffordable

384
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:44,129
Herr Bosse, why are there so many of you and so few of us?

385
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:51,130
Sorry, but this is daytime television

386
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:59,319
Don't distract us from our opinion with facts

387
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,299
So, where were you 8 years ago, let's say at 2pm?

388
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,150
Retired

389
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,900
Aha, very suspicious

390
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:08,299
Was he familiar with this ship?

391
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:11,369
That is the Aila, you were seen several times on board

392
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:13,940
Yes, I started working again there

393
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,064
To supplement... my pension...

394
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:17,618
Are there witnesses to this?
To supplement... my pension...

395
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:18,472
Are there witnesses to this?

396
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,759
Ah, that's difficult

397
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:27,710
Some aren't alive anymore, and some thought I was Rudi Carell

398
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,240
Herr Bosse, did you vote in 2013?

399
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,222
- Yes of course
- Ah ha ha

400
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:31,972
In this election, one third of the voters
- Yes of course
- Ah ha ha

401
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:33,722
In this election, one third of the voters

402
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:35,089
were over 60

403
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:38,899
Did your generation not have a disproportionately large influence on this election?

404
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,890
How can I help it if the young people don't vote?

405
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,609
Is it not true

406
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:43,610
that the government would like to give you your pension scheme
Is it not true

407
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,719
that the government would like to give you your pension scheme

408
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,630
as a thank you for your vote?

409
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,453
You don't mean that was a retrospective bribe

410
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:54,210
something like the morning after pill?

411
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,538
Now I'm really awake

412
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:59,460
Why am I sitting on the defendant's bench?

413
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,213
You!  How many children have you brought into the world?

414
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:05,684
That's irrelevant

415
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,448
- One
- One, hah!

416
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:09,042
At 36?
- One
- One, hah!

417
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:10,198
At 36?

418
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:10,458
You must have partied hard, huh?
At 36?

419
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,955
You must have partied hard, huh?

420
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,970
And you?

421
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,549
What did you pay into the retirement fund?

422
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:22,299
Nothing!  Not a cent!  He's a lawyer and because of this Law Society he gets

423
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,054
this extra provision, that's...

424
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:23,804
Now don't distract us from the facts, Interpol has calculated
this extra provision, that's...

425
00:22:23,804 --> 00:22:26,551
Now don't distract us from the facts, Interpol has calculated

426
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:31,659
Your pension "present" costs us about ̛€160 billion
- Yes, but only when

427
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:33,539
you make a projection based on the next 15 years

428
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:33,540
Great, but it's still the young people who pay
you make a projection based on the next 15 years

429
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,369
Great, but it's still the young people who pay

430
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,379
No, it's paid by all contributors

431
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,009
from 18 to 65
- So it's paid by all workers

432
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:41,010
No, the pensioners pay as well, because they receive a lower annuity rate
from 18 to 65
- So it's paid by all workers

433
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,269
No, the pensioners pay as well, because they receive a lower annuity rate

434
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:46,877
OK, now tell me, where exactly are we being screwed over?

435
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:48,477
I don't know, um, maybe...

436
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,617
Do you still need me here?

437
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,367
You!

438
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,150
You will stay here until you are guilty

439
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,920
Stop!  We need to admit something

440
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,430
We only simulating this inter-generational conflict

441
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,420
Just because it's so fun, look at the old wreck standing opposite

442
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,460
Jochen Busse

443
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,500
And it

444
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,079
You see, we actually like one another a lot

445
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,699
And this whole "war of the generations" is just a media concoction

446
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,909
I know it's hard to step down from an opinion just because the facts don't fit

447
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:26,059
But it's

448
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:30,683
You see, I also find it hard to dismiss the inter-generational conflict

449
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,959
Especially when I'm waiting in front of a pedestrian crossing

450
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,900
You know

451
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:54,099
And some pensioner, like a 56k modem,

452
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,100
shuffles across the street
And some pensioner, like a 56k modem,

453
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,000
shuffles across the street

454
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,470
And then the little Fokus reporter sitting on my shoulder says "Do it...

455
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,440
for the pension..."

456
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,744
I don't do it, of course

457
00:24:06,994 --> 00:24:08,494
Normally

458
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:11,829
No, really, but I should really do it

459
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:15,659
Because of the wage deductions

460
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,750
Everyone told me, end of the 80s it started, oh God, the wage deductions

461
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,089
As a teenager I was more afraid of rising wage deductions than of an

462
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:23,909
atomic war

463
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,400
It was beaten into us: the old people are living much too long

464
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,069
not for free

465
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:28,070
End of the 80s, one of the most famous films was what?
not for free

466
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,984
End of the 80s, one of the most famous films was what?

467
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:32,734
"Die Hard"

468
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,470
The plot was obvious:
When the pension fund contributions rise,

469
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,420
the wage dedictions will rise and explode and all your jobs will be

470
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,559
vaporised, yippee-yi-yay, Schweinebacken

471
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:44,560
But just before the pensioners could roll over us
vaporised, yippee-yi-yay, Schweinebacken

472
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,409
But just before the pensioners could roll over us

473
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,914
politics discovered this here:

474
00:24:50,164 --> 00:24:51,664
The Pension Formula

475
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,480
Look at this, does anyone want to solve this?

476
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,359
Correct, the answer is zero, absolutely correct

477
00:24:59,359 --> 00:24:59,360
And why?  That's because of all these factors here,
Correct, the answer is zero, absolutely correct

478
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,469
And why?  That's because of all these factors here,

479
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,740
these "moderating factors".

480
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,400
With this, politics have decreased pensions by let's say 25%

481
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,896
Did you hear the uproar in the population?
With this, politics have decreased pensions by let's say 25%

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:11,280
No, that's why they're called "moderating factors"

No, that's why they're called "moderating factors"

00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:26,000
Ladies and gentlemen, that, that was the, politics and everyone have

486
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,079
That was, I believe, the biggest pension decrease

487
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,980
in German history

488
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,730
Why did they do it?
in German history

489
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,529
Why did they do it?

490
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:31,581
Out of fear
Why did they do it?

491
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:32,619
Out of fear

492
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:35,079
Of demographic change

493
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,693
"Demographic change" - that's what people always said

494
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:40,356
Less and less young people have to feed more and more old people

495
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,920
The numbers were definite, the predictions were obvious

496
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,899
The young people, so, the number is halved,

497
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:48,204
the number of pensioners triples

498
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:48,309

the number of pensioners triples

The beauty of the disaster is
Disaster

501
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:51,309
The beauty of the disaster is

502
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:52,940
it's already happened

503
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,140
from 1900 up to the year 2000

504
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,980
From 1900 up to the year 2000, the number of young people doubled

505
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,019
and the number of pensioners tripled

506
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,839
And what did we do during that time?

507
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,671
Expanded out welfare systems

508
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:05,509
And

509
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:05,725
Out standard of living has improved
And

510
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:07,023
Out standard of living has improved

511
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,773
You'll ask me "How is this possible?

512
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:10,636
Germany's economic strength!"

513
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:12,200
I'll show you quickly: This is

514
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,280
aproximately the economic strength of Germany in the year 1950
I'll show you quickly: This is

aproximately the economic strength of Germany in the year 1950

516
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:19,069
So, those were the golden days.
From this cake, we only had to give

517
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:21,649
14% to the pensioners

518
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,210
Today, we have to give more than 30%

519
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,410
to the pensioners

520
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,079
That would be a problem

521
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:27,080
If we think that the cake has stayed the same size
That would be a problem

522
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,179
If we think that the cake has stayed the same size

523
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,369
It doesn't, the cake has, thanks to modern technology

524
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:33,370
and my lovely assistant
It doesn't, the cake has, thanks to modern technology

525
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,689
and my lovely assistant

526
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,517
That is the proportion, ladies and gentleman!

527
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:44,723
Thank you very much

528
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,868
That, ladies and gentlemen, is the cake that we can share

529
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,538
And still, we say we should make our belts a little tighter

530
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:53,859
And now you rightly say

531
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:57,039
"Wait, if there's so much cake there to share, what's with my pension?"

532
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,089
A small story

533
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,888
Imagine an employer

534
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:03,008
who invites every one to his birthday party every year, and every year

535
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:05,019
he bakes a larger cake

536
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:08,119
You come each year and get a smaller piece than last year

537
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,459
And you ask him why?

538
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,420
And he says, "Because otherwise we would all starve,"

539
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,730
and he points to an old man in the corner, whose piece of cake you immediately take

540
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,559
because you're afraid to starve

541
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,029
And because you're so caught up in a generation conflict with these old people in the corner,

542
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:26,529
you never find time to wonder who, in the story,

543
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:29,819
got the biggest part of the cake

544
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:31,490
The employer

545
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,109
But you're not allowed to say that too loudly

546
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,269
Otherwise someone will come and says "Shhhhh,

547
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:36,950
when the cake speaks,

548
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:43,950
the crumbs are silent."

549
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,486
We can come in?  Everyone gone?

550
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:55,789
No one's left?  That's good.

551
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,115
Sorry that I'm secretly creeping into the show

552
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:00,799
But I really have to warn you

553
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:00,865
That it's very, very dangerous, what the Herr von Wagner just did with you
But I really have to warn you

554
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:04,250
That it's very, very dangerous, what the Herr von Wagner just did with you

555
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,760
He tried to take away your fear

556
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,470
Fear of the demographical disaster

557
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:07,510
But fear, dear people
Fear of the demographical disaster

558
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,970
But fear, dear people

559
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,308
Fear is the biggest motivator to make something of yourself

560
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:15,099
Fear in your throat, hah?  It spurs you on, gives you the signal,

561
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:18,119
"People, get going, always bite off more than you can chew,

562
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,689
shove the others out of the way and screw the future

563
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,269
If you want to catch lots of fish,

564
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:24,379
has to fish with dynamite, huh?

565
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,203
Never give up, a German chicken fights until the barbeque!"

566
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:29,480
That is the positive side of fear

567
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,369
Yes sir!

568
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:32,370
You've noticed?
Yes sir!

569
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,559
You've noticed?

570
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,829
I'm Germany's first neoliberal caberettist

571
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:41,169
That's why I had to smuggle myself into the Insitution in this cake

572
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,051
To get myself access to this gang of left-wing weirdos,

573
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:46,259
who think you need to get to the bottom of everything

574
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:48,009
The pension formula, he's explaining to you?

575
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:51,368
Has he gone crazy?  That's much to complicated

576
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:52,148
You shouldn't even try to understand that

577
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,533
I tell you too much knowledge is also a hindrance
You shouldn't even try to understand that

578
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:56,009
I tell you too much knowledge is also a hindrance

579
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,660
Yeah, when you know too much, you end up spending 6 weeks

580
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,539
in an airport in Moscow, really not good

581
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:01,540
Although
in an airport in Moscow, really not good

582
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:08,510
Although

583
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:08,539
Excuse me
Although

584
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:09,417
Excuse me

585
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,630
To be entirely honest, Snowden, the guy, also completely overrated,

586
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,190
What he knows he also only got from the Internet, but...

587
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,205
No, don't always question everything

588
00:29:18,455 --> 00:29:20,369
Just let other people solve your problems

589
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:23,900
Just trust our government for once, Merkel will handle it
Just let other people solve your problems

590
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,619
I have complete trust in her

591
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:25,620
Really, how issues drip off her
I have complete trust in her

592
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,191
Really, how issues drip off her

593
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:28,627
She's just acting, right?

594
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:28,941
There aren't really any problems, ah?
She's just acting, right?

595
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,449
There aren't really any problems, ah?

596
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,569
Press conference, masterful statement from her

597
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:33,829
And after that she departs

598
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:34,319
with publicists, advisors and everyone in her wake
And after that she departs

599
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,058
with publicists, advisors and everyone in her wake

600
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:39,259
And then she always says something or other to them, you never hear it though

601
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:40,329
And that's what I find really cool, when she says,

602
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:42,399
"Yes, that's our position in the NSA affair"

603
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,339
And then she always stamps away like that

604
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:44,340
And I always imagine her saying to Seibert,
And then she always stamps away like that

605
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,450
And I always imagine her saying to Seibert,

606
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,200
"Hey Stefan, wanna play Playstation?"

607
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:51,009
Really, honestly!

608
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:51,374
When I see that, man, I know that she'll solve all your problems
Really, honestly!

609
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:55,279
When I see that, man, I know that she'll solve all your problems

610
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,450
And it's good like that

611
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,419
I mean, you already have enough to do fighting your own challenges

612
00:29:58,419 --> 00:29:59,419
Look what's expected from you
I mean, you already have enough to do fighting your own challenges

613
00:29:59,419 --> 00:29:59,759
Look what's expected from you

614
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,563
The whole day long, you try,
Look what's expected from you

615
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:03,009
The whole day long, you try,

616
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,429
with limited resources, to keep several things moving simulteneously

617
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,464
and to control them somehow with anticipatory actions

618
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:16,959
And that's the problem with complex challenges like this one here, that it...

619
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,823
Thank you very much

620
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:23,808
Yes, the problem

621
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,329
with complex challenges is that there are always multiple ways to solve them

622
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:31,250
And when there are multiple solutions, you have to constantly decide

623
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,762
when you need to step in, when to let go again, to keep everything

624
00:30:33,762 --> 00:30:35,102
moving simulaneously

625
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,381
That means, you're completely overwhelmed already

626
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,579
I mean, work is a series of ups and downs anyway

627
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:40,636
but again and again
I mean, work is a series of ups and downs anyway

628
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:41,569
but again and again

629
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:44,399
the question circles your head, "Are you the master

630
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,859
of all these processes,
or are they just being followed through,

631
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:47,860
one after the another?
of all these processes,
or are they just being followed through,

632
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,947
one after the another?

633
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,690
But of course also

634
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,179
because you get bogged down in the details in this whole

635
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:04,230
flood of information

636
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,644
You have the feeling you're not getting anywhere

637
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,075
Just turning around your own axis

638
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:12,356
Also because when implementing new processes you're often much too

639
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,970
clumsy

640
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,313
You're much too clumsy

641
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:18,063
Then of course mistake are made

642
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:26,769
You behave much too clumsily

643
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,398
Of course, to this is added a massive amount of social pressure

644
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,159
I mean, how often do you find yourself in some power political banter, yeah?

645
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,710
Sometimes also with your own boss, behind whose back

646
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,420
you always think,

647
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,980
"Man, does he really use both halves of his brain?"

648
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,470
How can he...
Permanent chaos in this place

649
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,640
The phone ringing constantly

650
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,859
You're happy when you can keep one hand on the keyboard, for at least

651
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:56,860
a little
You're happy when you can keep one hand on the keyboard, for at least

652
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,439
a little

653
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,900
research on the Internet

654
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,990
Everything is getting more and more hectic, faster, crazier

655
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,559
And you want to think critically?

656
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,679
I'll tell you one thing:

657
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,226
Just stay away

658
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,740
Herr Wopp!

659
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:32,815
How did you get in here?

660
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,420
I'm here to expand my customer base

661
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,970
The Trojan Cake, clever

662
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,259
We didn't occupy this show so men could play with their balls

663
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:47,720
I don't care about that

664
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,262
Tell me, have you ever thought about your future?
I don't care about that

665
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:50,660
Tell me, have you ever thought about your future?

666
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,430
Retirement plan?

667
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:57,000
You won't get a cent of pension for your occupation here

668
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,706
Yeah, short thoughts lead to long faces

669
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:03,210
It's a hard case

670
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,109
But I have something for you

671
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,009
A private pension

672
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:11,259
What about the company pension?

673
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:13,127
The company pension was part of the new coalition

674
00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:18,339
And you are lucky enough to he one of the first, come here

675
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:19,359
How should we do this?

676
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,560
Maybe a little role play?

677
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,369
Listen: Compay pension, private pension...

678
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,969
Herr Sieber, I think,

679
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:28,269
in our little game,

680
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:29,400
you can be the saver

681
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,116
What makes you think of that?

682
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:34,138
Just a guess

683
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:35,436
And Herr von Wagner,

684
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:36,588
you're the state

685
00:33:36,688 --> 00:33:38,188
That's right, I'm Mummy

686
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:42,129
And Herr Bosse is a pensioner

687
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,520
There must be something different about me

688
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,309
But Herr Bosse, you're not a normal pensioner, you're Herr Sieber in 50 years' time

689
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:54,919
My God, I really haven't aged well

690
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,720
No surprise considering what I had to work with

691
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,088
- Who am I then?
- Herr Uthoff,

692
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,320
you are the company

693
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,919
and have just started offering a company pension

694
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,118
Does that cost something?

695
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,219
No no, not a cent!

696
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,759
You just allow me

697
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:19,648
to set up contracts with your employees

698
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:20,828
Because the boss has approved it,

699
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:23,039
it looks more professional, OK?

700
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,489
Shall we start, Herr Sieber?
How much would you like to put aside?

701
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,568
Knowing you, I'd say

702
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:34,648
maximum contribution, right?
Terrible cliché, that

703
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:38,509
Let's do it

704
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,641
4% of your salary, every month, over 40 years!

705
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:44,241
And here comes the clincher:

706
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,356
The state will help you

707
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:47,956
Thanks to Mummy, you'll pay less taxes

708
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,159
and less social welfare

709
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,730
Herr Sieber, do you feel poorly?

710
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,750
A private pension plan and lower taxes, too

711
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,350
I'm having an orgasm

712
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:05,248
Wait, there's more, I'll throw something in too

713
00:35:05,248 --> 00:35:06,488
Interest

714
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:09,088
And compound interest

715
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:11,719
I can't take it!

716
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:14,019
How do private pension providers earn a living?

717
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:16,916
Look, it's Norbert Blüm!

718
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:17,992
Where?

719
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:20,441
Oh, he's gone

720
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:25,909
Your employer has your money for you

721
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:29,379
Is it time?

722
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,906
I'm going into retirement!

723
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:35,399
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

724
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:39,148
Well, I find this

725
00:35:39,148 --> 00:35:40,955
a bit small

726
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,555
It's much less than I paid!

727
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,874
That's a temporal illusion

728
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:49,889
Wait a minute, I'd like to see that in slow motion

729
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:03,758
Stop, stop!

730
00:36:04,048 --> 00:36:07,400
Every month you're putting 20% in your own pocket!

731
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,659
That's stealing!

732
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:09,660
Those are provision charges
That's stealing!

733
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,298
Those are provision charges

734
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:13,545
And what about the contributions you promised to pay?

735
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:15,145
That's an optional service

736
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,000
But you I heard it from your own tongue!

737
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,972
That's right,

738
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:19,139
a slip of the tongue

739
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:19,572
What about the guaranteed interest, how high is it?
a slip of the tongue

740
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:21,845
What about the guaranteed interest, how high is it?

741
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:23,445
Yes, that's around about...

742
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:25,539
percent or so

743
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:27,548
What?  I didn't catch that

744
00:36:27,548 --> 00:36:29,938
Yeah, that's about

745
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,269
1.5%

746
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:33,059
1.5%?

747
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:36,009
That's not even enough for poverty!

748
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:39,059
It's still more than I have here

749
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:42,434
It's like someone else was also helping themseves

750
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,958
Wait, slow motion

751
00:37:01,189 --> 00:37:02,532
Wait a minute

752
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:04,132
Frau Merkel

753
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:05,318
Hello

754
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:07,550
Frau Merkel you're in bed with Wopp

755
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,150
Pensions can't be tax free

756
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:12,519
But you said you'd subsidise the company pension scheme

757
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:15,704
The scheme, yes, but not the pension

758
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:21,379
You're stealing from a collection box

759
00:37:21,378 --> 00:37:23,089
on your way out

760
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,239
The important thing is that everyone saw your donation

761
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:27,240
So, that's purely contentions
It's OK as long as everyone noticed your donation

762
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,217
So, that's purely contentions

763
00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:29,509
But absolutely correct, yes

764
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:31,346
What's happening?

765
00:37:31,346 --> 00:37:34,649
Well, these are welfare payments, health insurance

766
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,118
You need to pay these too

767
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:36,471
And partly those of your boss

768
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:38,945
It's not called a company pension scheme for nothing

769
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,500
This is total crap

770
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,744
The employer gets to put his hands in twice and I don't get anything!

771
00:37:45,548 --> 00:37:47,789
I'd have been better off with the state pension

772
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:49,128
That's purely contentious

773
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,400
But absolutely correct

774
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,760
I have no future

775
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,209
with you

776
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,080
Future?  Oh please!

777
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,680
Who needs a future these days, right?

778
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:10,009
We have the great coalition

779
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,480
With that, you don't need a future anymore.

780
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,020
What do you we get from it?

781
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:18,750
A burnt-out CDU party, fading away in the glow

782
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,680
of a grey pant suit

783
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,280
teamed up with a completely depressed, disillusioned SPD

784
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,640
Feeding on the spit of their great leader, Sigmar Gabriel

785
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,820
Selling out every value they once had

786
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:33,007
And selling it to themselves as a success

787
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,440
That's where we're at

788
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,020
No more expectations

789
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,980
And they can't fulfill even these

790
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,200
And that is the difference to the Ukraine

791
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,640
That is the difference to the Ukraine, the people have already noticed it there

792
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,188
And when Egon Bahr stands up and says international politics

793
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,880
are never about human rights or democracy,

794
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,380
always about the interests of individual states

795
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,740
Then I'll say one thing to Herr Bahr

796
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,260
It's about the interests of those who have incorporated the state

797
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,500
Because before you export a democracy, you should have one yourself

798
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,620
And that doesn't look too good where we are, look

799
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,460
at the case of Edathy and Hans Peter Friedrich, I don't know if you remember him

800
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,606
He was our Internal Affairs Minister

801
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,500
He had to resign,

802
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
and this is the joke,

803
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,700
because he knew something

804
00:39:26,728 --> 00:39:30,148
And then he stupidly kept talking and revealed state secrets

805
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:33,719
Democracy has now become a self-service shop

806
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,880
for industry and politics

807
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,360
Where anyone can take, with a feudal flourish,

808
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,941
anything out which suits him

809
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,620
That's not even taking Uli Hoeneß into the equation

810
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,860
That's how far we've come

811
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,540
At the top, we have a chancellor,

812
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,220
a political fat maggot

813
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,760
Now it's getting fierce, don't be scared

814
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,789
Who has now pumped herself into power

815
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:54,440
and lost all interest in what she could do with it

816
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,068
I'm not criticising the fact that she's chancellor, I just think she could

817
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,500
show more interest in politics

818
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,520
She gets everything from the media, like in the Edathy affair:

819
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,500
"I have just heard that in the media."

820
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,360
"And about Ukraine, I've just heard that in the media, too."

821
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,920
I think, that's comforting, at least she still

822
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,880
reads the paper

823
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,880
I've criticised governments for wanting the wrong thing

824
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,840
But now I have to admit, this government doesn't want anything at all

825
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,960
Although, a country-wide minimum wage, we were promised that, and what comes?

826
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,020
It's not coming yet, and it won't come everywhere

827
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,200
What if you said that to your wife, "Honey, I love you,

828
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,820
but not now and not always, but apart from that...

829
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,510
We get along well, right?"

830
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,920
And the really important issues are swept under the carpet

831
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,100
The No Spy Agreement, it gets swept under the carpet, fizzles out

832
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,740
And at the same time, in secret negotiations, the...

833
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:59,450
the biggest agreements, they're sealed in clandestine negotiations

834
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,060
Now American products are coming to supermarkets,

835
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,660
complete rubbish, by the way

836
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,574
In America, products are classed as foodstuffs

837
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,720
which are forbidden here in hardware stores

838
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,000
Then I feel sick, let's come back to the Ukraine,

839
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:20,599
that our government just accepts that a war is starting in Europe

840
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:23,620
that people will have to die for democracy and freedom

841
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,500
but really just for the interests of big corporations

842
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,580
I feel sick

843
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,160
And then I do think that the great coalition is the right one at the right time

844
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,840
Germany has won this crisis, we've read that everwhere

845
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,210
And that's why I think that they'll do anything to make sure

846
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,940
that this crisis happens again

847
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,920
We're heading in the right direction, and Frau Merkel

848
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,420
will have a good excuse at the end

849
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,432
She'll say, "I'm chancellor?

850
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:47,460
Unfortunately I've also just learnt that from the media."

851
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,200
Good evening

852
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,714
I've explained it a thousand times, the situation is clear,

853
00:42:03,714 --> 00:42:05,288
we have a good state pension fund,

854
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:06,739
then the demographic lie,

855
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:07,574
pensions are cut,

856
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:10,294
everyone should look elsewhere, who gets the most out of this?

857
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:11,894
People like Wopp

858
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,414
The case is solved

859
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,078
Yes, it sounds completely plausible

860
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:16,822
But I still haven't understood

861
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:18,978
Then let's maybe put ourselves...

862
00:42:18,978 --> 00:42:19,055
Let's reconstruct the crime, and put ourselves in the enemy's shoes
Then let's maybe put ourselves...

863
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:22,948
Let's reconstruct the crime, and put ourselves in the enemy's shoes

864
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:24,115
Who do you want to be?

865
00:42:24,215 --> 00:42:25,715
We have the Deutsche Bank, the DWS

866
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:29,648
The Herold from the Deutsche Bank, Allianz Insurance

867
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:33,168
AXA, maybe, or Gothaer Insurance, Ergo Insurance, Victoria Insurance

868
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:34,369
or the AWD

869
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:36,188
All of them

870
00:42:36,188 --> 00:42:38,597
That's what I thought, congratulations, Herr Uthoff,

871
00:42:38,697 --> 00:42:40,999
you are private insurance

872
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:44,496
Let's imagine, 90s, beginning

873
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:45,918
Life insurance isn't doing too good

874
00:42:45,918 --> 00:42:46,096
What do you do?
Life insurance isn't doing too good

875
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:46,555
What do you do?

876
00:42:46,555 --> 00:42:47,185
Well, I need a new product
What do you do?

877
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:48,420
Well, I need a new product

878
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,020
- Yes!
- Private pension schemes

879
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:53,739
Good.  Just that the state pension system is so good that no one wants a private scheme

880
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:56,308
- Well, then I need to badmouth the system
- Yes

881
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:58,419
But you can't do that yourself

882
00:42:58,418 --> 00:43:00,139
Then I'll take a few independant experts

883
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:00,659
Beautiful!

884
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:00,738
I'll give you, for example, Meinhard Migel and Kurt Biedenkopf
Beautiful!

885
00:43:00,738 --> 00:43:05,239
I'll give you, for example, Meinhard Migel and Kurt Biedenkopf

886
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:07,159
What am I supposed to do with those CDU clowns?

887
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:10,152
You turn them into the German Pension Experts

888
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,750
By founding an institute

889
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,489
The IWG in Bonn, the institute for economy and society

890
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:19,076
- IWG - I'll Win Gold
- Yes

891
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:22,429
Not quite yet

892
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:25,849
But we're close, now all you need to do is ensure the IWG

893
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:28,360
draws conclusions which benefit you

894
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,130
That won't be a problem, I'll shove so much money in the arses

895
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,720
that the right thing comes out the other end

896
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,030
You can't do it quite like that

897
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,289
Then I'll put an institute in the middle

898
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:38,539
Better

899
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:41,797
"German Institute for Retirement Planning", the DIA

900
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:42,909
Funded by

901
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:43,670
The Deutsche Bank,

902
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,984
the DWS, and Deutscher Herold

903
00:43:46,184 --> 00:43:47,784
- So, by us
- Yes!

904
00:43:47,784 --> 00:43:49,689
And what do they get out of it?

905
00:43:49,688 --> 00:43:51,548
Yes, that get... wait a minute...

906
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:56,228
The state pension scheme is too expensive, and we need to insure privately

907
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:58,149
And that means here, here, here and here

908
00:43:58,751 --> 00:43:59,882
I have to think of everyone

909
00:43:59,882 --> 00:44:00,759
Very good!

910
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,246
But now it's like this:

911
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:05,695
The state pensions are still to high

912
00:44:06,323 --> 00:44:08,656
Yes, and people like Norber Blüm don't want

913
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:10,224
to expose you completely

914
00:44:10,324 --> 00:44:11,824
Pig

915
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:15,318
What do you do now?

916
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:16,667
- I'll go to his superior!
- Yes sir!

917
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,700
It's just that Kohl doesn't feel like changing anything, after 16 years in power

918
00:44:19,797 --> 00:44:20,765
Then I need a new one

919
00:44:20,865 --> 00:44:24,369
Ah, it's '98, people feel like a change, and who could...

920
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,239
- Gerhard Schröder
- Yes!

921
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,500
Wait, he has this pal, Maschmeyer

922
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,809
- He works for us, I know him, he'll handle everything
- Excellent

923
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:35,369
Carsten Maschmeyer from the AWD

924
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:35,370
Now you only have one problem:
Carsten Maschmeyer from the AWD

925
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,600
Now you only have one problem:

926
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,506
Something is obstructing Schröder

927
00:44:38,606 --> 00:44:40,106
Oh, his wife

928
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:44,909
No, Oskar Lafontaine

929
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:46,839
He doesn't like your private retirement plan at all

930
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:47,349
Pig

931
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,322
Remember you have Maschmayer

932
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:52,630
Then I go to him and say, "Maschy, Baby,

933
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:57,422
put it in every newspaper that the next chancellor must be from Niedersachsen."

934
00:44:57,522 --> 00:44:59,022
Yes!  It works, Schröder becomes chancellor,

935
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,999
he gets rid of Lafontaine

936
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:05,128
And is very thankful to do everything you tell him to

937
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:08,378
But how can I be sure that really choose a private pension?

938
00:45:08,378 --> 00:45:12,583
Um, like I said, you just have Schröder decrease pension payments

939
00:45:12,683 --> 00:45:15,416
Private retirement schemes are subsidised, and then let's do something like

940
00:45:15,516 --> 00:45:16,540
the Riester scheme

941
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,110
Ah, the oil reservoir

942
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:21,354
But we drill even deeper, Herr Uthoff

943
00:45:21,454 --> 00:45:25,437
How about having Schröder found a committee of experts

944
00:45:25,537 --> 00:45:28,037
And have a look if we don't need another pension reform

945
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:31,019
This committee could maybe be called Rürup

946
00:45:32,744 --> 00:45:34,552
Then lets fill it with all manner of experts

947
00:45:34,552 --> 00:45:35,855
Very good, I'll give you for example

948
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,555
Professor Bert Rürup

949
00:45:37,555 --> 00:45:41,876
Wonderful, he's on the board of AXA and Gothaer Insurance

950
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:47,605
Very nice.  And he's the head of the Munich research institute for the economics of aging

951
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,590
- Which is completely funded by us
- Yes

952
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,190
I like how you think

953
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,688
- I also have Herr Raffelhüschen...
- He's... he's much more...

954
00:45:56,688 --> 00:46:02,278
wage-dependent!  He works at Ergo, and at Victoria!

955
00:46:02,278 --> 00:46:06,568
Lovely!  So, the Rürup Committee comes to the conclusion

956
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:09,299
that pensions need to go down 25%

957
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,899
What does Schröder do?

958
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:13,398
Lowers pensions by 25%

959
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:15,910
That means more profit for you

960
00:46:16,048 --> 00:46:17,099
How nice

961
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,059
But I feel a bit guilty

962
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:19,458
You?

963
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:21,210
Look, these men have worked so hard

964
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,999
to castrate the state retirement system

965
00:46:22,998 --> 00:46:25,860
Can't I have a little something come their way?

966
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,460
Millions in contract fees

967
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:31,659
But a million like that disappears so quickly

968
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:34,278
With such a measly pension at the end

969
00:46:34,278 --> 00:46:36,378
Don't worry, look at this

970
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,978
Professor - civil servant, so pension

971
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,608
And here a lawyer, so law society, we spoke about that before

972
00:46:41,608 --> 00:46:46,720
Politician, also pension, and here again, and again, and again

973
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,780
And this guy

974
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,780
has a rich wife

975
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:54,119
That means everyone

976
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,539
who has worked here to destroy the retirement system

977
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:59,668
aren't dependent on it

978
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:02,069
That's a scandal, that's crying out for revolution

979
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,069
To the barricades for a good state pension fund!

980
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:06,379
One that every one puts money into

981
00:47:06,479 --> 00:47:07,979
Civil servants, politicians,

982
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:08,819
even you, Herr Uthoff

983
00:47:19,308 --> 00:47:21,708
Why the Ukranian flag now?

984
00:47:21,808 --> 00:47:23,308
That's not the Ukranian flag,

985
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,620
that's the flag of the German pension fund

986
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,659
Very nice

987
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:32,749
Pension murderer!

988
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:36,075
Is the guillotine ready?

989
00:47:36,175 --> 00:47:37,675
The revolution kicks off

990
00:47:40,278 --> 00:47:43,259
We still need a charismatic leader

991
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:46,630
Maybe someone who can meet the people on the street

992
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,429
at eye level

993
00:47:52,818 --> 00:48:15,334
[It's Norbert Blüm]

994
00:48:16,298 --> 00:48:18,298
I'll do it

995
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:23,768
Great!  Come!

996
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:26,289
A politician as a revolutionary leader

997
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:28,958
it'll be our ruin

998
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,678
So, for 20 years

999
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,249
I've had the pension system thrown in my face

1000
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:38,945
And now I'm hitting back!

1001
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:47,730
But first we need to question a few things

1002
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,066
That's even worse than the guillotine!

1003
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:51,666
Guillotine!

1004
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,494
You cut off the legs off the pension system

1005
00:48:54,594 --> 00:48:56,594
And now you say it won't stand!

1006
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,438
You said the pension scheme

1007
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,248
was too expensive

1008
00:49:02,248 --> 00:49:07,009
You didn't notice, with the state system there would have been much more money

1009
00:49:07,409 --> 00:49:10,199
to pay the pensions

1010
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:12,878
People said

1011
00:49:12,878 --> 00:49:15,739
the pension system wasn't effective

1012
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:20,688
My God, the administration costs of the state pension system

1013
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:24,707
are 1.5% of its takings

1014
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:26,307
Private retirement schemes:

1015
00:49:26,648 --> 00:49:29,513
20% and more

1016
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:33,559
And then there's all the pencil pushers

1017
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:37,728
Advertising, dividends

1018
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:40,068
I'll say one more thing

1019
00:49:40,068 --> 00:49:41,668
People said

1020
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:44,888
State pensions weren't secure

1021
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:46,798
More than 100 years

1022
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:48,538
The state pension fund

1023
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:54,299
survived every disaster, every crisis in the last century

1024
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:57,018
Hyperinflation, two world wars

1025
00:49:57,018 --> 00:49:58,438
You can't say that

1026
00:49:58,438 --> 00:50:00,248
about private insurance

1027
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:03,268
Their history is the history of

1028
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:05,521
broken promises

1029
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,547
That is the truth!

1030
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:12,881
One question

1031
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:18,424
Tell me, an old-school Marxist such as yourself,

1032
00:50:19,048 --> 00:50:23,579
could you tell us what's written on this banner?

1033
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,229
It says

1034
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:27,748
You did that on purpose

1035
00:50:27,748 --> 00:50:28,968
It says

1036
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:30,659
"The pension fund is secure"

1037
00:50:35,862 --> 00:50:39,097
That was the Institution

1038
00:50:39,097 --> 00:50:41,097
Occupied today by...
